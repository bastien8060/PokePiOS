# PokePi
Flexible Pokedex Framework for Raspberry Pi

## Build

Download repo + navigate to it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bastien8060/PokePi
cd PokePi
```

Change to the top-level Buildroot directory:

```sh
cd buildroot
```

Use initialized configurations to compile:

```sh
make all
```

This may take anywhere from 10min to 30min or even a couple hours to do from scratch, depending on the speed of your machine.
